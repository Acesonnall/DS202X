## Working with Git
My name is Omar Taylor and I study Computer Engineering, but you can call me an Electron Cowboy.
<br />
In the past month, I have been preparing for graduate school and evaluating a few full-time offers. Being an adult is hard.
<br />
The most use tools in my toolbox are:
- Jetbrains IDEs
- Git
- Hierarchical stucturing of my folders for organization
